    \section main_intro Introduction

    CoolReader Engine is a XML/CSS based
    visualization library for writing e-book readers.

    The goal is to write fast, compact and portable library
    which allows to create e-book readers for different platform
    including handheld devices with limited resources.

    This library is partially based on CoolReader2 e-book reader,
    but most parts are rewritten from scratch.

    \b Features:

    - Different font engines support
        - grayscale bitmap font engine
        - Win32 font support
        - TTF fonts support via Freetype library
    - Text formatter with support of different paragraph and font styles,
        which allows to prepare text to be drawed
    - XML parser with support of unicode (UTF-8 and UTF-16) and 8-bit encodings
    - 2 different DOM tree implementations
        - Tiny DOM - compact readonly DOM tree
            - doesn't use RAM to store document text but reads it from file by demand
            - doesn't store formatted text in memory, but generates it on the fly
            - parsed tree can be saved to file to allow fast re-opening of documents
            - compact tree structure requires minimum amount of RAM
            - optimized element names, attribute names and values string storing
        - Fast DOM (in progress, not included to distribution) - fast but compact read/write tree
            - editable document tree
            - faster implementation
            - optimized element names, attribute names and values string storing
    - Styles: CSS2 subset implementation
        - only simple selectors ( element-name or universal selector * )
        - definition for properties
            - display
            - white-space
            - text-align
            - vertical-align
            - font-family
            - font-size
            - font-style
            - font-weight
            - text-indent
            - line-height
            - width
            - height
            - margin-left
            - margin-right
            - margin-top
            - margin-bottom
            - margin
            - page-break-before
            - page-break-after
            - page-break-inside
    - DOM/CSS formatter allows to prepare document for drawing
    - Sample applications
        - FB2 e-book reader for Windows
        - FB2 e-book reader for X (Linux)
    - Tools
        - TrueType to grayscale bitmap font convertor

    \section main_install Installation

    - download source code from CoolReader homepage http://www.coolreader.org/
    - unpack archieve into some folder
    - change options in crsetup.h file if necessary
    - build library
    - build sample applications located in /tools folder

    \note current version supports only build under Win32 with MS VC++ 6.0


    \section getting_started Getting started


    Please see Tools/Fb2Test/Fb2Test.cpp source code for sample code.

    Library implements \a LVDocView class which can read XML document from
    file and draw it in grayscale buffer.

    Before loading of document, you have to initialize font manager:

    \b InitFontManager( lString8() );

    Please register fonts you want to make available using call of RegisterFont method.
    For bitmap font manager, parameter is filename of bitmap font.

    \b fontMan->RegisterFont( lString8(fn) );

    Typical usage of LVDocView:
    - Load document using LVDocView::LoadDocument() method.
    - Call LVDocView::setStyleSheet() to set stylesheet for document.
    - Set draw buffer dimensions using LVDocView::Resize(dx, dy).
    - LVDocView::Draw() draws document into gray buffer.
    - \a DrawBuf2DC() can be used to draw gray bitmap in Windows device context.
    - LVDocView::GetPos() and LVDocView::SetPos() can be used to scroll throuh document.
